## Acknowledgments

The author would like to thank:

- **Professor Bing-Hong Liu** for the inspiring discussions that led to this book. Our conversations about the gap between textbook data structures and real-world performance were the catalyst for this project.

- **The open-source community** for creating the tools that made this book possible—perf, Valgrind, GCC, LLVM, and countless others.

- **Performance engineering pioneers** including Brendan Gregg, Fedor Pikus, Ulrich Drepper, and Agner Fog, whose work has shaped the field and influenced this book.

- **Colleagues and mentors** at SiFive, MIPS, Andes, Broadcom, Western Digital, and SiS for sharing their expertise and providing the real-world experiences that inform the examples in this book.

- **Early reviewers** who provided valuable feedback on draft chapters and helped improve both technical accuracy and clarity.

- **Family and friends** for their unwavering support and patience during the writing process.

## About the Book

**"Data Structures in Practice"** addresses a critical gap in computer science education: the disconnect between textbook data structures and their real-world performance on modern hardware. This book combines:

- **Hardware-aware perspective** based on actual cache behavior, memory hierarchy, and performance measurements
- **Practical insights** from 20+ years of embedded systems and system software development
- **Rigorous benchmarking** with all performance claims backed by actual measurements
- **Real-world case studies** from bootloaders, device drivers, and firmware development

The book is organized into 5 parts covering foundations (memory hierarchy, benchmarking), basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, hash tables), trees and hierarchies (BSTs, B-trees, tries, heaps), advanced topics (lock-free structures, strings, graphs, probabilistic structures), and case studies (bootloader, device driver, firmware). Five comprehensive appendices provide benchmark framework reference, hardware reference, tool reference, further reading, and hands-on exercises.

This volume focuses on **practical performance**—understanding why an O(log n) algorithm can outperform an O(1) algorithm, when to use arrays instead of linked lists, and how to design data structures that work with hardware rather than against it.

## 📖 About This Book

*Data Structures in Practice* is a comprehensive guide to data structures from a hardware-aware perspective, designed for system software engineers who need to understand not just *what* data structures do, but *how* they perform on real hardware.

### What Makes This Book Different

- **Hardware-First Approach**: Every data structure is analyzed through the lens of cache behavior, memory hierarchy, and CPU microarchitecture
- **Real-World Performance**: Actual benchmark data from modern processors (RISC-V, ARM, x86)
- **System Software Focus**: Examples from bootloaders, device drivers, firmware, and embedded systems
- **Bilingual**: Complete English and Traditional Chinese versions

### What You'll Learn

- How cache misses affect linked list performance
- Why array-of-structs vs struct-of-arrays matters for SIMD
- When to use B-trees vs hash tables in embedded systems
- How to benchmark and profile data structures correctly
- Lock-free data structures for concurrent systems
- Memory allocator design and fragmentation analysis
